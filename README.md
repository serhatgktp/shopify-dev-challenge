# shopify-dev-challenge

A fun little application that allows you to add and remove (optionally password protected) images from a repository!

Each time an image is uploaded, the user has the option to choose whether or not they would like to assign the image to an account.

A user may also:

- Create an account
- Change the credentials of an existing account
- Add images
- Remove images

This is a shell program, and was done as part of a challenge from Shopify!
